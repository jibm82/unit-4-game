## How to play

* When the game starts, players will need to chose a `hero` by clicking on one of the characters at the bottom of the screen. Each character has different health points, attack power and counter attack power. 

Once the `hero` has been selected, then an `enemy` needs to be selected to start fighting.

A `hero` can attack the current `enemy` by clicking on the `attack` button. Every attack goes like this:
- The `hero` attacks first, every hit reduces the `enemy` health points. If the `enemy` health points reaches zero then the `enemy` is defeated. With each attack the hero becomes more powerful.
- If the `enemy` wasn't defeated, then he will counter-attack. The hero's health points will be reduced. Enemies don't get more powerful. 
- The character who's health points reaches zero will be defeated.
- If the `hero` defeats all enemies, the player wins the game.
